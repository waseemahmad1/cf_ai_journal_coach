## AI Prompts Used

### 1. Planning
> “I want to make a journaling app with Cloudflare Workers AI. How should I go about doing this? Can you outline the structure of the project and what files I need”

### 2. Debugging
> “I think my worker is deployed but the frontend can’t connect to it, how can I debug the routing issue? I'm getting a network error”

### 3. KV Integration
> “How can I store and retrieve memory with KV inside a Worker? I don't want to slow down performance though”

### 4️⃣ Deployment Help
> “I deployed my Worker but I don't know how to connect it to Cloudflare Pages for the frontend."

### 5️⃣ Documentation & Testing
> “How should I write my README to make the setup easy for other SWEs?”
